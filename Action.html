        <h1>Less City Residents Can Help Lower the COVID-19 Death Rate.</h1>
    <p> Lower Population Density, means lower death rate from COVID-19. Once the population density is reduced by decreasing city residents, the death rate of COVID-19 will become much lower</p>

        Three graphs above are showing above. The first Chart on the right is the Geo Chart representing how severe the infection of COVID-19 is for each state. The color of the dots on the map represent how large is the death rate of COVID-19, and the size of the dots represent how large is the total COVID-19 in each state. Also, the yellow coloring for each states represents the population density. The other two charts are showing the correlation between the population density and the COVID-19 death rate.
        </p>
       
     <p><h3>
        As the scatterplots showing, there is a clear linear correlation between population density and COVID-19 death rate. Lowering the population density of a state could be an effective way to reduce the COVID-19 death rate. Cities are the most concentrated places that contributed most to population density in every state. Therefore, reducing city residents can help lower the death rate of COVID-19.</h3>

        However, there's an extraordinary outlier in the first scatterplot showing that population density in some place do not have correlation with death rate of COVID-19. This outlier is District of Columbia. It has higher population density, but have relatively medium death rate of COVID-19
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Nevertheless, District of Columbia is a city instead of a state. Each state consists of a number of cities. District of Columbia should not be in the consideration. After taking District of Columbia out of map, the linear pattern shows again on the last scatterplot.
